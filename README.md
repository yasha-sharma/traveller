                THE CLI TRAVELLER GAME
   
There’s a journey waiting for you in the world of Traveller.

But beware — not every country welcomes you. Some may even throw you in prison.

To begin your adventure, you’ll need access to a command line.

Once you’re ready, clone this repo, or download it as a zip file.

Open a Terminal, go to the location of the files, and start by reading the file 'instructions'.

One way you can do this is with the command:
cat instructions
